## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I designed myself into a corner from the first iteration of BitFit.
Most of its menus didn't make sense once more features were being added.
Refactoring the app has been a valuable lesson in using the development lifecycle.
The planning phase is important!
